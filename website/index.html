            I will go through the main periods of music in this resource, to give you a better understanding of the evolution of music (and art) as humanity progresses. <br>

            <br><i>Note: much of early classical music is comprised of religious music, which will be included in the list so that you get a better understanding of the era. If you do not believe in the faith, we hope that you are able to treat the religious music as pieces of art for you to enjoy and understand. </i>

            The Renaissance

            <p>
                    During the Renaissance era, music became widespread as the <b>invention of the printing press</b> allowed for the wide circulation of music. Furthermore, the people in the Renaissance era believed in the concept of the <b>"universal man"</b> <br>
            </p>

            <p>
        
                The main stimulus for music-making in this era was <b>text</b>. Music was mainly used to <b>enhance the <i>meaning</i> and <i>value</i> of texts. </b>Therefore, there was a <b>greater change in mood</b> as a piece progresses. Generally, its tone sounds more <b>relaxed and stable</b>, and each vocal line in choir arrangements would have <b>great independence over one another</b>, and <b>phrases overlapped</b> to create a <b>seamless flow of sound</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Generally, the instrumentation was for <b>solo voice with instrument</b>, but occasionally there would be instrumental music (<i>usually for dancing</i>) and choral arrangements too.
